# Shoe Inventory Tracking System Using C Language
*Case Study for the course Computer Programming 2*

Instructions:
The inventory of a shoe store lists shoes by stock number. With each stock number, there is associated a style number in the range of 0 to 50, the number of pairs in each size (sizes range from 3 to 14), and a price. A program is to be written to keep track of the inventory. The user is given the following choices: enter a new record, display a record, change the price of the stock item, or change the number on hand. When specifying a record, the user may give either the stock number or the style number. The array index can be used as a stock number. If the user decides to change the stock on hand, the program should ask which sizes will have their stock on hand changed. The program should be designed to run indefinitely, keeping track of changes in stock.
